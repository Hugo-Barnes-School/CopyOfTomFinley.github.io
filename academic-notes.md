Notes that I have taken while in school or compiled while TA-ing.

### [Discrete Math and Theory 1][dmt]

Notes for UVA's CS2120 course that I compiled while working for Professor Orrico. 
The notes follow her class faily closely and are divided into the four units that
she divides the class into.

### [Data Structures and Algorithms][dsa]

Notes that I compiled because I figured they would be useful to have, they do not
follow any courses at UVA. Potentially useful for quick reminders on various Data
Structures and Algorithms.

### [Calculus][calc]

These notes largely follow Gilbert Strang's calculus textbook and Dr.McMillan's Calculus Packets. 
Similarly with the above DSA notes, I hope they will be useful for miscellaneous lookups.
